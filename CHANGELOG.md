- **New:** Allow to override `propagate_traces` in `Celery` per task (#2331) by @jan-auer

  For more information, see the documentation for [Celery](https://docs.sentry.io//platforms/python/guides/celery/#distributed-traces) for more information.

  Usage:
  ```python
    import sentry_sdk

    sentry_sdk.init(
        dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
        integrations=[
            CeleryIntegration(propagate_traces=True),
        ],
    )

    ...

    # This will NOT propagate the trace. (The task will start its own trace):
    my_task_b.apply_async(
        args=("some_parameter", ),
        headers={"sentry-propagate-traces": False},
    )
  ```

## 1.30.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Officially support Python 3.11 (#2300) by @sentrivana
- Context manager monitor (#2290) by @szokeasaurusrex
- Set response status code in transaction `response` context. (#2312) by @antonpirker
- Add missing context kwarg to `_sentry_task_factory` (#2267) by @JohnnyDeuss
- In Postgres take the connection params from the connection  (#2308) by @antonpirker
- Experimental: Allow using OTel for performance instrumentation (#2272) by @sentrivana

    This release includes experimental support for replacing Sentry's default
    performance monitoring solution with one powered by OpenTelemetry without having
    to do any manual setup.

    Try it out by installing `pip install sentry-sdk[opentelemetry-experimental]` and
    then initializing the SDK with:

    ```python
    sentry_sdk.init(
        # ...your usual options...
        _experiments={"otel_powered_performance": True},
    )
    ```

    This enables OpenTelemetry performance monitoring support for some of the most
    popular frameworks and libraries (Flask, Django, FastAPI, requests...).

    We're looking forward to your feedback! Please let us know about your experience
    in this discussion: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/55023

    **Important note:** Please note that this feature is experimental and in a
    proof-of-concept stage and is not meant for production use. It may be changed or
    removed at any point.

- Enable backpressure handling by default (#2298) by @sl0thentr0py

    The SDK now dynamically downsamples transactions to reduce backpressure in high
    throughput systems. It starts a new `Monitor` thread to perform some health checks
    which decide to downsample (halved each time) in 10 second intervals till the system
    is healthy again.

    To disable this behavior, use:

    ```python
    sentry_sdk.init(
        # ...your usual options...
        enable_backpressure_handling=False,
    )
    ```

    If your system serves heavy load, please let us know how this feature works for you!

    Check out the [documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#enable-backpressure-handling) for more information.

## 1.25.1

### Django update (ongoing)

Collections of improvements to our Django integration.

By: @mgaligniana (#1773)

### Various fixes & improvements

- Fix `parse_url` (#2161) by @sentrivana and @antonpirker

  Our URL sanitization used in multiple integrations broke with the recent Python security update. If you started seeing `ValueError`s with `"'Filtered' does not appear to be an IPv4 or IPv6 address"`, this release fixes that. See [the original issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/2160) for more context.

- Better version parsing in integrations (#2152) by @antonpirker

  We now properly support all integration versions that conform to [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). This replaces our naïve version parsing that wouldn't accept versions such as `2.0.0rc1` or `2.0.5.post1`.

- Align HTTP status code as span data field `http.response.status_code` (#2113) by @antonpirker
- Do not encode cached value to determine size (#2143) by @sentrivana
- Fix using `unittest.mock` whenever available (#1926) by @mgorny
- Fix 2.7 `common` tests (#2145) by @sentrivana
- Bump `actions/stale` from `6` to `8` (#1978) by @dependabot
- Bump `black` from `22.12.0` to `23.3.0` (#1984) by @dependabot
- Bump `mypy` from `1.2.0` to `1.3.0` (#2110) by @dependabot
- Bump `sphinx` from `5.3.0` to `7.0.1` (#2112) by @dependabot

## 1.25.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Support urllib3>=2.0.0 (#2148) by @asottile-sentry

  We're now supporting urllib3's new major version, 2.0.0. If you encounter issues (e.g. some of your dependencies not supporting the new urllib3 version yet) you might consider pinning the urllib3 version to `<2.0.0` manually in your project. Check out the [the urllib3 migration guide](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-migration-guide.html#migrating-as-an-application-developer) for details.

- Auto-retry tests on failure (#2134) by @sentrivana
- Correct `importlib.metadata` check in `test_modules` (#2149) by @asottile-sentry
- Fix distribution name normalization (PEP-0503) (#2144) by @rominf
- Fix `functions_to_trace` typing (#2141) by @rcmarron

## 1.24.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** Celery Beat exclude tasks option (#2130) by @antonpirker

  You can exclude Celery Beat tasks from being auto-instrumented. To do this, add a list of tasks you want to exclude as option `exclude_beat_tasks` when creating `CeleryIntegration`. The list can contain simple strings with the full task name, as specified in the Celery Beat schedule, or regular expressions to match multiple tasks.

  For more information, see the documentation for [Crons](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/guides/celery/crons/) for more information.

  Usage:

  ```python
      exclude_beat_tasks = [
          "some-task-a",
          "payment-check-.*",
      ]
      sentry_sdk.init(
          dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
          integrations=[
              CeleryIntegration(
                  monitor_beat_tasks=True,
                  exclude_beat_tasks=exclude_beat_tasks,
              ),
          ],
      )
  ```

  In this example the task `some-task-a` and all tasks with a name starting with `payment-check-` will be ignored.

- **New:** Add support for **ExceptionGroups** (#2025) by @antonpirker

  _Note:_ If running Self-Hosted Sentry, you should wait to adopt this SDK update until after updating to the 23.6.0 (est. June 2023) release of Sentry. Updating early will not break anything, but you will not get the full benefit of the Exception Groups improvements to issue grouping that were added to the Sentry backend.

- Prefer `importlib.metadata` over `pkg_resources` if available (#2081) by @sentrivana
- Work with a copy of request, vars in the event (#2125) by @sentrivana
- Pinned version of dependency that broke the build (#2133) by @antonpirker

## 1.23.1

### Various fixes & improvements

- Disable Django Cache spans by default. (#2120) by @antonpirker

## 1.23.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** Add `loguru` integration (#1994) by @PerchunPak

  Check [the documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/integrations/loguru/) for more information.

  Usage:

  ```python
  from loguru import logger
  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru import LoguruIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
      integrations=[
          LoguruIntegration(),
      ],
  )

  logger.debug("I am ignored")
  logger.info("I am a breadcrumb")
  logger.error("I am an event", extra=dict(bar=43))
  logger.exception("An exception happened")
  ```

  - An error event with the message `"I am an event"` will be created.
  - `"I am a breadcrumb"` will be attached as a breadcrumb to that event.
  - `bar` will end up in the `extra` attributes of that event.
  - `"An exception happened"` will send the current exception from `sys.exc_info()` with the stack trace to Sentry. If there's no exception, the current stack will be attached.
  - The debug message `"I am ignored"` will not be captured by Sentry. To capture it, set `level` to `DEBUG` or lower in `LoguruIntegration`.

- Do not truncate request body if `request_bodies` is `"always"` (#2092) by @sentrivana
- Fixed Celery headers for Beat auto-instrumentation (#2102) by @antonpirker
- Add `db.operation` to Redis and MongoDB spans (#2089) by @antonpirker
- Make sure we're importing `redis` the library (#2106) by @sentrivana
- Add `include_source_context` option (#2020) by @farhat-nawaz and @sentrivana
- Import `Markup` from `markupsafe` (#2047) by @rco-ableton

- Remove relay extension from AWS Layer (#2068) by @sl0thentr0py
- Add a note about `pip freeze` to the bug template (#2103) by @sentrivana

## 1.22.2

### Various fixes & improvements

- Fix: Django caching spans when using keyword arguments (#2086) by @antonpirker
- Fix: Duration in Celery Beat tasks monitoring (#2087) by @antonpirker
- Fix: Docstrings of SPANDATA (#2084) by @antonpirker

## 1.22.1

### Various fixes & improvements

- Fix: Handle a list of keys (not just a single key) in Django cache spans (#2082) by @antonpirker

## 1.22.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Add `cache.hit` and `cache.item_size` to Django (#2057) by @antonpirker

  _Note:_ This will add spans for all requests to the caches configured in Django. This will probably add some overhead to your server an also add multiple spans to your performance waterfall diagrams. If you do not want this, you can disable this feature in the DjangoIntegration:

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="...",
      integrations=[
          DjangoIntegration(cache_spans=False),
      ]
  )
  ```

- Use `http.method` instead of `method` (#2054) by @AbhiPrasad

- Use `functools.wrap` for `ThreadingIntegration` patches to fix attributes (#2080) by @EpicWink
- Pin `urllib3` to <2.0.0 for now (#2069) by @sl0thentr0py

## 1.21.1

### Various fixes & improvements

- Do not send monitor_config when unset (#2058) by @evanpurkhiser
- Add `db.system` span data (#2040, #2042) by @antonpirker
- Fix memory leak in profiling (#2049) by @Zylphrex
- Fix crash loop when returning none in before_send (#2045) by @sentrivana

## 1.21.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Better handling of redis span/breadcrumb data (#2033) by @antonpirker

  _Note:_ With this release we will limit the description of redis db spans and the data in breadcrumbs represting redis db operations to 1024 characters.

  This can can lead to truncated data. If you do not want this there is a new parameter `max_data_size` in `RedisIntegration`. You can set this to `None` for disabling trimming.

  Example for **disabling** trimming of redis commands in spans or breadcrumbs:

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
    integrations=[
      RedisIntegration(max_data_size=None),
    ]
  )
  ```

  Example for custom trim size of redis commands in spans or breadcrumbs:

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
    integrations=[
      RedisIntegration(max_data_size=50),
    ]
  )`

  ```

- Add `db.system` to redis and SQLAlchemy db spans (#2037, #2038, #2039) (#2037) by @AbhiPrasad
- Upgraded linting tooling (#2026) by @antonpirker
- Made code more resilient. (#2031) by @antonpirker

## 1.20.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Send all events to /envelope endpoint when tracing is enabled (#2009) by @antonpirker

  _Note:_ If you’re self-hosting Sentry 9, you need to stay in the previous version of the SDK or update your self-hosted to at least 20.6.0

- Profiling: Remove profile context from SDK (#2013) by @Zylphrex
- Profiling: Additionl performance improvements to the profiler (#1991) by @Zylphrex

## 1.19.1

### Various fixes & improvements

- Make auto monitoring beat update support Celery 4 and 5 (#1989) by @antonpirker

## 1.19.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** [Celery Beat](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html) auto monitoring (#1967) by @antonpirker

  The CeleryIntegration can now also monitor your Celery Beat scheduled tasks automatically using the new [Crons](https://blog.sentry.io/2023/01/04/cron-job-monitoring-beta-because-scheduled-jobs-fail-too/) feature of Sentry.

  To learn more see our [Celery Beat Auto Discovery](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/guides/celery/crons/) documentation.

  Usage:

  ```python
  from celery import Celery, signals
  from celery.schedules import crontab

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration


  app = Celery('tasks', broker='...')
  app.conf.beat_schedule = {
      'set-in-beat-schedule': {
          'task': 'tasks.some_important_task',
          'schedule': crontab(...),
      },
  }


  @signals.celeryd_init.connect
  def init_sentry(**kwargs):
      sentry_sdk.init(
          dsn='...',
          integrations=[CeleryIntegration(monitor_beat_tasks=True)],  # 👈 here
          environment="local.dev.grace",
          release="v1.0",
      )
  ```

  This will auto detect all schedules tasks in your `beat_schedule` and will monitor them with Sentry [Crons](https://blog.sentry.io/2023/01/04/cron-job-monitoring-beta-because-scheduled-jobs-fail-too/).

- **New:** [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) integration (#1911) by @hossein-raeisi

  The [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) integration instruments all incoming requests and outgoing unary-unary, unary-stream grpc requests using grpcio channels.

  To learn more see our [gRPC Integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/integrations/grpc/) documentation.

  On the server:

  ```python
  import grpc
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.grpc.server import ServerInterceptor


  server = grpc.server(
      thread_pool=...,
      interceptors=[ServerInterceptor()],
  )
  ```

  On the client:

  ```python
  import grpc
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.grpc.client import ClientInterceptor


  with grpc.insecure_channel("example.com:12345") as channel:
      channel = grpc.intercept_channel(channel, *[ClientInterceptor()])

  ```

- **New:** socket integration (#1911) by @hossein-raeisi

  Use this integration to create spans for DNS resolves (`socket.getaddrinfo()`) and connection creations (`socket.create_connection()`).

  To learn more see our [Socket Integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/integrations/socket/) documentation.

  Usage:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.socket import SocketIntegration
  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
      integrations=[
          SocketIntegration(),
      ],
  )
  ```

- Fix: Do not trim span descriptions. (#1983) by @antonpirker

## 1.18.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** Implement `EventScrubber` (#1943) by @sl0thentr0py

  To learn more see our [Scrubbing Sensitive Data](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/sensitive-data/#event-scrubber) documentation.

  Add a new `EventScrubber` class that scrubs certain potentially sensitive interfaces with a `DEFAULT_DENYLIST`. The default scrubber is automatically run if `send_default_pii = False`:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.scrubber import EventScrubber
  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...
      send_default_pii=False,
      event_scrubber=EventScrubber(),  # this is set by default
  )
  ```

  You can also pass in a custom `denylist` to the `EventScrubber` class and filter additional fields that you want.

- **New:** Added new `functions_to_trace` option for central way of performance instrumentation (#1960) by @antonpirker

  To learn more see our [Tracing Options](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#functions-to-trace) documentation.

  An optional list of functions that should be set up for performance monitoring. For each function in the list, a span will be created when the function is executed.

  ```python
  functions_to_trace = [
      {"qualified_name": "tests.test_basics._hello_world_counter"},
      {"qualified_name": "time.sleep"},
      {"qualified_name": "collections.Counter.most_common"},
  ]

  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...
      traces_sample_rate=1.0,
      functions_to_trace=functions_to_trace,
  )
  ```

## 1.17.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** Monitor Celery Beat tasks with Sentry [Cron Monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/).

  With this feature you can make sure that your Celery beat tasks run at the right time and see if they where successful or not.

  > **Warning**
  > Cron Monitoring is currently in beta. Beta features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
  > If you have any questions or feedback, please email us at crons-feedback@sentry.io, reach out via Discord (#cronjobs), or open an issue.

  Usage:

  ```python
  # File: tasks.py

  from celery import Celery, signals
  from celery.schedules import crontab

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.crons import monitor
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration


  # 1. Setup your Celery beat configuration

  app = Celery('mytasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')
  app.conf.beat_schedule = {
      'set-in-beat-schedule': {
          'task': 'tasks.tell_the_world',
          'schedule': crontab(hour='10', minute='15'),
          'args': ("in beat_schedule set", ),
      },
  }


  # 2. Initialize Sentry either in `celeryd_init` or `beat_init` signal.

  #@signals.celeryd_init.connect
  @signals.beat_init.connect
  def init_sentry(**kwargs):
      sentry_sdk.init(
          dsn='...',
          integrations=[CeleryIntegration()],
          environment="local.dev.grace",
          release="v1.0.7-a1",
      )


  # 3. Link your Celery task to a Sentry Cron Monitor

  @app.task
  @monitor(monitor_slug='3b861d62-ff82-4aa0-9cd6-b2b6403bd0cf')
  def tell_the_world(msg):
      print(msg)
  ```

- **New:** Add decorator for Sentry tracing (#1089) by @ynouri

  This allows you to use a decorator to setup custom performance instrumentation.

  To learn more see [Custom Instrumentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/).

  Usage: Just add the new decorator to your function, and a span will be created for it:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk

  @sentry_sdk.trace
  def my_complex_function():
    # do stuff
    ...
  ```

## 1.16.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** Add [arq](https://arq-docs.helpmanual.io/) Integration (#1872) by @Zhenay

  This integration will create performance spans when arq jobs will be enqueued and when they will be run.
  It will also capture errors in jobs and will link them to the performance spans.

  Usage:

  ```python
  import asyncio

  from httpx import AsyncClient
  from arq import create_pool
  from arq.connections import RedisSettings

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.arq import ArqIntegration
  from sentry_sdk.tracing import TRANSACTION_SOURCE_COMPONENT

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="...",
      integrations=[ArqIntegration()],
  )

  async def download_content(ctx, url):
      session: AsyncClient = ctx['session']
      response = await session.get(url)
      print(f'{url}: {response.text:.80}...')
      return len(response.text)

  async def startup(ctx):
      ctx['session'] = AsyncClient()

  async def shutdown(ctx):
      await ctx['session'].aclose()

  async def main():
      with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="testing_arq_tasks", source=TRANSACTION_SOURCE_COMPONENT):
          redis = await create_pool(RedisSettings())
          for url in ('https://facebook.com', 'https://microsoft.com', 'https://github.com', "asdf"
                      ):
              await redis.enqueue_job('download_content', url)

  class WorkerSettings:
      functions = [download_content]
      on_startup = startup
      on_shutdown = shutdown

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      asyncio.run(main())
  ```

## 1.15.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- New: Add [Huey](https://huey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Integration (#1555) by @Zhenay

  This integration will create performance spans when Huey tasks will be enqueued and when they will be executed.

  Usage:

  Task definition in `demo.py`:

  ```python
  import time

  from huey import SqliteHuey, crontab

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.huey import HueyIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="...",
      integrations=[
          HueyIntegration(),
      ],
      traces_sample_rate=1.0,
  )

  huey = SqliteHuey(filename='/tmp/demo.db')

  @huey.task()
  def add_numbers(a, b):
      return a + b
  ```

  Running the tasks in `run.py`:

  ```python
  from demo import add_numbers, flaky_task, nightly_backup

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.huey import HueyIntegration
  from sentry_sdk.tracing import TRANSACTION_SOURCE_COMPONENT, Transaction


  def main():
      sentry_sdk.init(
          dsn="...",
          integrations=[
              HueyIntegration(),
          ],
          traces_sample_rate=1.0,
      )

      with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="testing_huey_tasks", source=TRANSACTION_SOURCE_COMPONENT):
          r = add_numbers(1, 2)

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      main()
  ```

    def strip_sensitive_data(event, hint):
        # modify event here (or return `None` if you want to drop the event entirely)
        return event

    sentry_sdk.init(
        # ...
        before_send_transaction=strip_sensitive_data,
    )
  ```

### Various fixes & improvements

- Unified naming for span ops (#1661) by @antonpirker

  We have unified the strings of our span operations. See https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-operations/

  **WARNING**: If you have Sentry Dashboards or Sentry Discover queries that use `transaction.op` in their fields, conditions, aggregates or columns this change could potentially break your Dashboards/Discover setup.
  Here is a list of the changes we made to the `op`s. Please adjust your dashboards and Discover queries accordingly:

  | Old operation (`op`)     | New Operation (`op`)   |
  | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
  | `asgi.server`            | `http.server`          |
  | `aws.request`            | `http.client`          |
  | `aws.request.stream`     | `http.client.stream`   |
  | `celery.submit`          | `queue.submit.celery`  |
  | `celery.task`            | `queue.task.celery`    |
  | `django.middleware`      | `middleware.django`    |
  | `django.signals`         | `event.django`         |
  | `django.template.render` | `template.render`      |
  | `django.view`            | `view.render`          |
  | `http`                   | `http.client`          |
  | `redis`                  | `db.redis`             |
  | `rq.task`                | `queue.task.rq`        |
  | `serverless.function`    | `function.aws`         |
  | `serverless.function`    | `function.gcp`         |
  | `starlette.middleware`   | `middleware.starlette` |

### Various fixes & improvements

- Let SentryAsgiMiddleware work with Starlette and FastAPI integrations (#1594) by @antonpirker

**Note:** The last version 1.9.6 introduced a breaking change where projects that used Starlette or FastAPI
and had manually setup `SentryAsgiMiddleware` could not start. This versions fixes this behaviour.
With this version if you have a manual `SentryAsgiMiddleware` setup and are using Starlette or FastAPI
everything just works out of the box.

Sorry for any inconveniences the last version might have brought to you.

We can do better and in the future we will do our best to not break your code again.

  The SDK now propagates the [W3C Baggage Header](https://www.w3.org/TR/baggage/) from
  incoming transactions to outgoing requests.
  It also extracts Sentry specific [sampling information](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/dynamic-sampling-context/)
  and adds it to the transaction headers to enable Dynamic Sampling in the product.

- Fix timezone bugs in AWS Lambda integration.
- Fix crash on GCP integration because of missing parameter `timeout_warning`.

## 0.16.4

- Add experiment to avoid trunchating span descriptions. Initialize with `init(_experiments={"smart_transaction_trimming": True})`.
- Add a span around the Django view in transactions to distinguish its operations from middleware operations.

## 0.16.3

- Fix a bug in the Pyramid integration where the transaction name could not be overridden at all.
- Fix a broken type annotation on `capture_exception`.
- Basic support for Django 3.1. More work is required for async middlewares to be instrumented properly for APM.

- Various performance improvements to event sending.
- Avoid crashes when scope or hub is racy.
- Revert a change that broke applications using gevent and channels (in the same virtualenv, but different processes).
- Fix a bug that made the SDK crash on unicode in SQL.

## 0.12.2

- Fix a crash with ASGI (Django Channels) when the ASGI request type is neither HTTP nor Websockets.

## 0.12.1

- Temporarily remove sending of SQL parameters (as part of breadcrumbs or spans for APM) to Sentry to avoid memory consumption issues.

## 0.12.0

- Sentry now has a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cWnMQeA)! Join the server to get involved into SDK development and ask questions.
- Fix a bug where the response object for httplib (or requests) was held onto for an unnecessarily long amount of time.
- APM: Add spans for more methods on `subprocess.Popen` objects.
- APM: Add spans for Django middlewares.
- APM: Add spans for ASGI requests.
- Automatically inject the ASGI middleware for Django Channels 2.0. This will **break your Channels 2.0 application if it is running on Python 3.5 or 3.6** (while previously it would "only" leak a lot of memory for each ASGI request). **Install `aiocontextvars` from PyPI to make it work again.**

## 0.11.2

- Fix a bug where the SDK would throw an exception on shutdown when running under eventlet.
- Add missing data to Redis breadcrumbs.

## 0.10.2

- Fix a bug where a log record with non-strings as `extra` keys would make the SDK crash.
- Added ASGI integration for better hub propagation, request data for your events and capturing uncaught exceptions. Using this middleware explicitly in your code will also fix a few issues with Django Channels.
- Fix a bug where `celery-once` was deadlocking when used in combination with the celery integration.
- Fix a memory leak in the new tracing feature when it is not enabled.

## 0.10.1

- Fix bug in stdlib integration that would cause spawned subprocesses to not inherit the environment variables from the parent process.

## 0.10.0

- Massive refactor in preparation to tracing. There are no intentional breaking changes, but there is a risk of breakage (hence the minor version bump). Two new client options `traces_sample_rate` and `traceparent_v2` have been added. Do not change the defaults in production, they will bring your application down or at least fill your Sentry project up with nonsense events.

## 0.9.5

- Do not use `getargspec` on Python 3 to evade deprecation warning.
