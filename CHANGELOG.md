# Changelog and versioning

## Versioning Policy

This project follows [semver](https://semver.org/), with three additions:

- Semver says that major version `0` can include breaking changes at any time. Still, it is common practice to assume that only `0.x` releases (minor versions) can contain breaking changes while `0.x.y` releases (patch versions) are used for backwards-compatible changes (bugfixes and features). This project also follows that practice.

- All undocumented APIs are considered internal. They are not part of this contract.

- Certain features (e.g. integrations) may be explicitly called out as "experimental" or "unstable" in the documentation. They come with their own versioning policy described in the documentation.

We recommend to pin your version requirements against `0.x.*` or `0.x.y`.
Either one of the following is fine:

```
sentry-sdk>=0.10.0,<0.11.0
sentry-sdk==0.10.1
```

A major release `N` implies the previous release `N-1` will no longer receive updates. We generally do not backport bugfixes to older versions unless they are security relevant. However, feel free to ask for backports of specific commits on the bugtracker.

- **Breaking change**: Remove the `traceparent_v2` option. The option has been ignored since 0.16.3, just remove it from your code.

## 0.16.5

- Fix a bug that caused Django apps to crash if the view didn't have a `__name__` attribute.

## 0.16.4

- Add experiment to avoid trunchating span descriptions. Initialize with `init(_experiments={"smart_transaction_trimming": True})`.
- Add a span around the Django view in transactions to distinguish its operations from middleware operations.

## 0.16.3

- Fix AWS Lambda support for Python 3.8.
- The AWS Lambda integration now captures initialization/import errors for Python 3.
- The AWS Lambda integration now supports an option to warn about functions likely to time out.

## 0.16.0

- Redis integration: add tags for more commands
- Redis integration: Patch rediscluster package if installed.

- **Breaking change**: Revamping of the tracing API.
- **Breaking change**: `before_send` is no longer called for transactions.

## 0.15.1

## 0.15.0

- **Breaking change:** The ASGI middleware will now raise an exception if contextvars are not available, like it is already the case for other asyncio integrations.
- Contextvars are now used in more circumstances following a bugfix release of `gevent`. This will fix a few instances of wrong request data being attached to events while using an asyncio-based web framework.
- APM: Fix a bug in the SQLAlchemy integration where a span was left open if the database transaction had to be rolled back. This could have led to deeply nested span trees under that db query span.
- Fix a bug in the Pyramid integration where the transaction name could not be overridden at all.
- Fix a broken type annotation on `capture_exception`.
- Basic support for Django 3.1. More work is required for async middlewares to be instrumented properly for APM.

## 0.14.4

- Fix bugs in transport rate limit enforcement for specific data categories. The bug should not have affected anybody because we do not yet emit rate limits for specific event types/data categories.
- Fix a bug in `capture_event` where it would crash if given additional kwargs. Thanks to Tatiana Vasilevskaya!
- Fix a bug where contextvars from the request handler were inaccessible in AIOHTTP error handlers.
- Fix a bug where the Celery integration would crash if newrelic instrumented Celery as well.

## 0.14.3

- Attempt to use a monotonic clock to measure span durations in Performance/APM.
- Avoid overwriting explicitly set user data in web framework integrations.
- Allow to pass keyword arguments to `capture_event` instead of configuring the scope.
- Feature development for session tracking.

## 0.14.2

## 0.14.1

- Fix a crash in the Django integration when used in combination with Django Rest Framework's test utilities for request.

- Fix trace continuation bugs in APM.
- No longer report `asyncio.CancelledError` as part of AIOHTTP integration.

- Update schema sent for transaction events (transaction status).
- Fix a bug where `None` inside request data was skipped/omitted.

## 0.13.3

- Fix an issue with the ASGI middleware that would cause Uvicorn to infer the wrong ASGI versions and call the wrapped application with the wrong argument count.
- Do not ignore the `tornado.application` logger.
- The Redis integration now instruments Redis blaster for breadcrumbs and transaction spans.

## 0.13.2

- Fix a bug in APM that would cause wrong durations to be displayed on non-UTC servers.

- Add new global functions for setting scope/context data.
- Fix a bug that would make Django 1.11+ apps crash when using function-based middleware.

## 0.13.0

- Remove an old deprecation warning (behavior itself already changed since a long time).
- The AIOHTTP integration now attaches the request body to crash reports. Thanks to Vitali Rebkavets!
- Add an experimental PySpark integration.
- First release to be tested under Python 3.8. No code changes were necessary though, so previous releases also might have worked.

## 0.12.3

- Various performance improvements to event sending.
- Avoid crashes when scope or hub is racy.
- Revert a change that broke applications using gevent and channels (in the same virtualenv, but different processes).
- Fix a bug that made the SDK crash on unicode in SQL.

## 0.12.2

- Fix a crash with ASGI (Django Channels) when the ASGI request type is neither HTTP nor Websockets.

## 0.12.1

- Temporarily remove sending of SQL parameters (as part of breadcrumbs or spans for APM) to Sentry to avoid memory consumption issues.

## 0.12.0

- Sentry now has a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cWnMQeA)! Join the server to get involved into SDK development and ask questions.
- Fix a bug where the response object for httplib (or requests) was held onto for an unnecessarily long amount of time.
- APM: Add spans for more methods on `subprocess.Popen` objects.
- APM: Add spans for Django middlewares.
- APM: Add spans for ASGI requests.
- Automatically inject the ASGI middleware for Django Channels 2.0. This will **break your Channels 2.0 application if it is running on Python 3.5 or 3.6** (while previously it would "only" leak a lot of memory for each ASGI request). **Install `aiocontextvars` from PyPI to make it work again.**

## 0.11.2

- Fix a bug where the SDK would throw an exception on shutdown when running under eventlet.
- Add missing data to Redis breadcrumbs.

- Fix a reference cycle in the `ThreadingIntegration` that led to exceptions on interpreter shutdown. Thanks Guang Tian Li!
- Fix a series of bugs in the stdlib integration that broke usage of `subprocess`.
- More instrumentation for APM.
- New integration for SQLAlchemy (creates breadcrumbs from queries).
- New (experimental) integration for Apache Beam.
- Fix a bug in the `LoggingIntegration` that would send breadcrumbs timestamps in the wrong timezone.

- Fix a bug that caused infinite recursion when serializing local variables that logged errors or otherwise created Sentry events.

## 0.10.2

- Fix a bug where a log record with non-strings as `extra` keys would make the SDK crash.
- Added ASGI integration for better hub propagation, request data for your events and capturing uncaught exceptions. Using this middleware explicitly in your code will also fix a few issues with Django Channels.
- Fix a bug where `celery-once` was deadlocking when used in combination with the celery integration.
- Fix a memory leak in the new tracing feature when it is not enabled.

## 0.10.1

- Fix bug in stdlib integration that would cause spawned subprocesses to not inherit the environment variables from the parent process.

## 0.10.0

- Massive refactor in preparation to tracing. There are no intentional breaking changes, but there is a risk of breakage (hence the minor version bump). Two new client options `traces_sample_rate` and `traceparent_v2` have been added. Do not change the defaults in production, they will bring your application down or at least fill your Sentry project up with nonsense events.

## 0.9.5

- Do not use `getargspec` on Python 3 to evade deprecation warning.

- Include user agent header when sending events.

## 0.9.2

- Fix a bug in the Django integration that would prevent the user from initializing the SDK at the top of `settings.py`.

## 0.9.1

- Fix a bug on Python 3.7 where gunicorn with gevent would cause the SDK to leak event data between requests.

- Remove a few more headers containing sensitive data per default.
