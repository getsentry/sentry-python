### Integrations

- Bottle: Add `failed_request_status_codes` (#3618) by @szokeasaurusrex

  You can now define a set of integers that will determine which status codes
  should be reported to Sentry.

    ```python
    sentry_sdk.init(
        integrations=[
            BottleIntegration(
                failed_request_status_codes={403, *range(500, 600)},
            )
        ]
    )
    ```

  Examples of valid `failed_request_status_codes`:

  - `{500}` will only send events on HTTP 500.
  - `{400, *range(500, 600)}` will send events on HTTP 400 as well as the 5xx range.
  - `{500, 503}` will send events on HTTP 500 and 503.
  - `set()` (the empty set) will not send events for any HTTP status code.

  The default is `{*range(500, 600)}`, meaning that all 5xx status codes are reported to Sentry.

- Bottle: Delete never-reached code (#3605) by @szokeasaurusrex
- Redis: Remove flaky test (#3626) by @sentrivana
- Django: Improve getting `psycopg3` connection info (#3580) by @nijel
- Django: Add `SpotlightMiddleware` when Spotlight is enabled (#3600) by @BYK
- Django: Open relevant error when `SpotlightMiddleware` is on (#3614) by @BYK
- Django: Support `http_methods_to_capture` in ASGI Django (#3607) by @sentrivana

  ASGI Django now also supports the `http_methods_to_capture` integration option. This is a configurable tuple of HTTP method verbs that should create a transaction in Sentry. The default is `("CONNECT", "DELETE", "GET", "PATCH", "POST", "PUT", "TRACE",)`. `OPTIONS` and `HEAD` are not included by default.

  Here's how to use it:

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
      integrations=[
          DjangoIntegration(
              http_methods_to_capture=("GET", "POST"),
          ),
      ],
  )
  ```

## 2.15.0

### Integrations

- Configure HTTP methods to capture in ASGI/WSGI middleware and frameworks (#3531) by @antonpirker

  We've added a new option to the Django, Flask, Starlette and FastAPI integrations called `http_methods_to_capture`. This is a configurable tuple of HTTP method verbs that should create a transaction in Sentry. The default is `("CONNECT", "DELETE", "GET", "PATCH", "POST", "PUT", "TRACE",)`. `OPTIONS` and `HEAD` are not included by default.

  Here's how to use it (substitute Flask for your framework integration):

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
      integrations=[
        FlaskIntegration(
            http_methods_to_capture=("GET", "POST"),
        ),
    ],
  )
  ```

- Django: Allow ASGI to use `drf_request` in `DjangoRequestExtractor` (#3572) by @PakawiNz
- Django: Don't let `RawPostDataException` bubble up (#3553) by @sentrivana
- Django: Add `sync_capable` to `SentryWrappingMiddleware` (#3510) by @szokeasaurusrex
- AIOHTTP: Add `failed_request_status_codes` (#3551) by @szokeasaurusrex

  You can now define a set of integers that will determine which status codes
  should be reported to Sentry.

    ```python
    sentry_sdk.init(
        integrations=[
            AioHttpIntegration(
                failed_request_status_codes={403, *range(500, 600)},
            )
        ]
    )
    ```

  Examples of valid `failed_request_status_codes`:

  - `{500}` will only send events on HTTP 500.
  - `{400, *range(500, 600)}` will send events on HTTP 400 as well as the 5xx range.
  - `{500, 503}` will send events on HTTP 500 and 503.
  - `set()` (the empty set) will not send events for any HTTP status code.

  The default is `{*range(500, 600)}`, meaning that all 5xx status codes are reported to Sentry.

- AIOHTTP: Delete test which depends on AIOHTTP behavior (#3568) by @szokeasaurusrex
- AIOHTTP: Handle invalid responses (#3554) by @szokeasaurusrex
- FastAPI/Starlette: Support new `failed_request_status_codes` (#3563) by @szokeasaurusrex

  The format of `failed_request_status_codes` has changed from a list
  of integers and containers to a set:

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
      integrations=StarletteIntegration(
          failed_request_status_codes={403, *range(500, 600)},
      ),
  )
  ```

  The old way of defining `failed_request_status_codes` will continue to work
  for the time being. Examples of valid new-style `failed_request_status_codes`:

  - `{500}` will only send events on HTTP 500.
  - `{400, *range(500, 600)}` will send events on HTTP 400 as well as the 5xx range.
  - `{500, 503}` will send events on HTTP 500 and 503.
  - `set()` (the empty set) will not send events for any HTTP status code.

  The default is `{*range(500, 600)}`, meaning that all 5xx status codes are reported to Sentry.

### Various fixes & improvements

- Add `disabled_integrations` (#3328) by @sentrivana

  Disabling individual integrations is now much easier.
  Instead of disabling all automatically enabled integrations and specifying the ones
  you want to keep, you can now use the new
  [`disabled_integrations`](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#auto-enabling-integrations)
  config option to provide a list of integrations to disable:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.flask import FlaskIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      # Do not use the Flask integration even if Flask is installed.
      disabled_integrations=[
          FlaskIntegration(),
      ],
  )
  ```

## 2.10.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Add client cert and key support to `HttpTransport` (#3258) by @grammy-jiang

  Add `cert_file` and `key_file` to your `sentry_sdk.init` to use a custom client cert and key. Alternatively, the environment variables `CLIENT_CERT_FILE` and `CLIENT_KEY_FILE` can be used as well.

- OpenAI: Lazy initialize tiktoken to avoid http at import time (#3287) by @colin-sentry
- OpenAI, Langchain: Make tiktoken encoding name configurable + tiktoken usage opt-in (#3289) by @colin-sentry

  Fixed a bug where having certain packages installed along the Sentry SDK caused an HTTP request to be made to OpenAI infrastructure when the Sentry SDK was initialized. The request was made when the `tiktoken` package and at least one of the `openai` or `langchain` packages were installed.

  The request was fetching a `tiktoken` encoding in order to correctly measure token usage in some OpenAI and Langchain calls. This behavior is now opt-in. The choice of encoding to use was made configurable as well. To opt in, set the `tiktoken_encoding_name` parameter in the OpenAPI or Langchain integration.

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
      integrations=[
          OpenAIIntegration(tiktoken_encoding_name="cl100k_base"),
          LangchainIntegration(tiktoken_encoding_name="cl100k_base"),
      ],
  )

## 2.5.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Allow to configure status codes to report to Sentry in Starlette and FastAPI (#3008) by @sentrivana

  By passing a new option to the FastAPI and Starlette integrations, you're now able to configure what
  status codes should be sent as events to Sentry. Here's how it works:

  ```python
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.fastapi import FastApiIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...
      integrations=[
          StarletteIntegration(
              failed_request_status_codes=[403, range(500, 599)],
          ),
          FastApiIntegration(
              failed_request_status_codes=[403, range(500, 599)],
          ),
      ]
  )
  ```

  `failed_request_status_codes` expects a list of integers or containers (objects that allow membership checks via `in`)
  of integers. Examples of valid `failed_request_status_codes`:

  - `[500]` will only send events on HTTP 500.
  - `[400, range(500, 599)]` will send events on HTTP 400 as well as the 500-599 range.
  - `[500, 503]` will send events on HTTP 500 and 503.

  The default is `[range(500, 599)]`.

  See the [FastAPI](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/fastapi/) and [Starlette](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/starlette/) integration docs for more details.

## 2.0.0

This is the first major update in a *long* time!

We dropped support for some ancient languages and frameworks (Yes, Python 2.7 is no longer supported). Additionally we refactored a big part of the foundation of the SDK (how data inside the SDK is handled).

We hope you like it!

For a shorter version of what you need to do, to upgrade to Sentry SDK 2.0 see: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/migration/1.x-to-2.x

### New Features

- Additional integrations will now be activated automatically if the SDK detects the respective package is installed: Ariadne, ARQ, asyncpg, Chalice, clickhouse-driver, GQL, Graphene, huey, Loguru, PyMongo, Quart, Starlite, Strawberry.
- Added new API for custom instrumentation: `new_scope`, `isolation_scope`. See the [Deprecated](#deprecated) section to see how they map to the existing APIs.

### Changed
(These changes are all backwards-incompatible. **Breaking Change** (if you are just skimming for that phrase))

- The Pyramid integration will not capture errors that might happen in `authenticated_userid()` in a custom `AuthenticationPolicy` class.
- The method `need_code_loation` of the `MetricsAggregator` was renamed to `need_code_location`.
- The `BackgroundWorker` thread used to process events was renamed from `raven-sentry.BackgroundWorker` to `sentry-sdk.BackgroundWorker`.
- The `reraise` function was moved from `sentry_sdk._compat` to `sentry_sdk.utils`.
- The `_ScopeManager` was moved from `sentry_sdk.hub` to `sentry_sdk.scope`.
- Moved the contents of `tracing_utils_py3.py` to `tracing_utils.py`. The `start_child_span_decorator` is now in `sentry_sdk.tracing_utils`.
- The actual implementation of `get_current_span` was moved to `sentry_sdk.tracing_utils`. `sentry_sdk.get_current_span` is still accessible as part of the top-level API.
- `sentry_sdk.tracing_utils.add_query_source()`: Removed the `hub` parameter. It is not necessary anymore.
- `sentry_sdk.tracing_utils.record_sql_queries()`: Removed the `hub` parameter. It is not necessary anymore.
- `sentry_sdk.tracing_utils.get_current_span()` does now take a `scope` instead of a `hub` as parameter.
- `sentry_sdk.tracing_utils.should_propagate_trace()` now takes a `Client` instead of a `Hub` as first parameter.
- `sentry_sdk.utils.is_sentry_url()` now takes a `Client` instead of a `Hub` as first parameter.
- `sentry_sdk.utils._get_contextvars` does not return a tuple with three values, but a tuple with two values. The `copy_context` was removed.
- If you create a transaction manually and later mutate the transaction in a `configure_scope` block this does not work anymore. Here is a recipe on how to change your code to make it work:
    Your existing implementation:
    ```python
    transaction = sentry_sdk.transaction(...)

    # later in the code execution:

    with sentry_sdk.configure_scope() as scope:
        scope.set_transaction_name("new-transaction-name")
    ```

    needs to be changed to this:
    ```python
    transaction = sentry_sdk.transaction(...)

    # later in the code execution:

    scope = sentry_sdk.get_current_scope()
    scope.set_transaction_name("new-transaction-name")
    ```
- The classes listed in the table below are now abstract base classes. Therefore, they can no longer be instantiated. Subclasses can only be instantiated if they implement all of the abstract methods.
  <details>
    <summary><b>Show table</b></summary>

  | Class                                 | Abstract methods                       |
  | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
  | `sentry_sdk.integrations.Integration` | `setup_once`                           |
  | `sentry_sdk.metrics.Metric`           | `add`, `serialize_value`, and `weight` |
  | `sentry_sdk.profiler.Scheduler`       | `setup` and `teardown`                 |
  | `sentry_sdk.transport.Transport`      | `capture_envelope`                     |

    </details>

### Removed
(These changes are all backwards-incompatible. **Breaking Change** (if you are just skimming for that phrase))

- Removed support for Python 2 and Python 3.5. The SDK now requires at least Python 3.6.
- Removed support for Celery 3.\*.
- Removed support for Django 1.8, 1.9, 1.10.
- Removed support for Flask 0.\*.
- Removed support for gRPC < 1.39.
- Removed support for Tornado < 6.
- Removed `last_event_id()` top level API. The last event ID is still returned by `capture_event()`, `capture_exception()` and `capture_message()` but the top level API `sentry_sdk.last_event_id()` has been removed.
- Removed support for sending events to the `/store` endpoint. Everything is now sent to the `/envelope` endpoint. If you're on SaaS you don't have to worry about this, but if you're running Sentry yourself you'll need version `20.6.0` or higher of self-hosted Sentry.
- The deprecated `with_locals` configuration option was removed. Use `include_local_variables` instead. See https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#include-local-variables.
- The deprecated `request_bodies` configuration option was removed. Use `max_request_body_size`. See https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#max-request-body-size.
- Removed support for `user.segment`. It was also removed from the trace header as well as from the dynamic sampling context.
- Removed support for the `install` method for custom integrations. Please use `setup_once` instead.
- Removed `sentry_sdk.tracing.Span.new_span`. Use `sentry_sdk.tracing.Span.start_child` instead.
- Removed `sentry_sdk.tracing.Transaction.new_span`. Use `sentry_sdk.tracing.Transaction.start_child` instead.
- Removed support for creating transactions via `sentry_sdk.tracing.Span(transaction=...)`. To create a transaction, please use `sentry_sdk.tracing.Transaction(name=...)`.
- Removed `sentry_sdk.utils.Auth.store_api_url`.
- `sentry_sdk.utils.Auth.get_api_url`'s now accepts a `sentry_sdk.consts.EndpointType` enum instead of a string as its only parameter. We recommend omitting this argument when calling the function, since the parameter's default value is the only possible `sentry_sdk.consts.EndpointType` value. The parameter exists for future compatibility.
- Removed `tracing_utils_py2.py`. The `start_child_span_decorator` is now in `sentry_sdk.tracing_utils`.
- Removed the `sentry_sdk.profiler.Scheduler.stop_profiling` method. Any calls to this method can simply be removed, since this was a no-op method.

### Deprecated

- Using the `Hub` directly as well as using hub-based APIs has been deprecated. Where available, use [the top-level API instead](sentry_sdk/api.py); otherwise use the [scope API](sentry_sdk/scope.py) or the [client API](sentry_sdk/client.py).

  Before:

  ```python
  with hub.start_span(...):
      # do something
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk

  with sentry_sdk.start_span(...):
      # do something
  ```

- Hub cloning is deprecated.

  Before:

  ```python
  with Hub(Hub.current) as hub:
      # do something with the cloned hub
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk

  with sentry_sdk.isolation_scope() as scope:
      # do something with the forked scope
  ```

- `configure_scope` is deprecated. Use the new isolation scope directly via `get_isolation_scope()` instead.

  Before:

  ```python
  with configure_scope() as scope:
      # do something with `scope`
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  from sentry_sdk import get_isolation_scope

  scope = get_isolation_scope()
  # do something with `scope`
  ```

- `push_scope` is deprecated. Use the new `new_scope` context manager to fork the necessary scopes.

  Before:

  ```python
  with push_scope() as scope:
      # do something with `scope`
  ```

  After:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk

  with sentry_sdk.new_scope() as scope:
      # do something with `scope`
  ```

- Accessing the client via the hub has been deprecated. Use the top-level `sentry_sdk.get_client()` to get the current client.
- `profiler_mode` and `profiles_sample_rate` have been deprecated as `_experiments` options. Use them as top level options instead:
  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
      ...,
      profiler_mode="thread",
      profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
  )
  ```
- Deprecated `sentry_sdk.transport.Transport.capture_event`. Please use `sentry_sdk.transport.Transport.capture_envelope`, instead.
- Passing a function to `sentry_sdk.init`'s `transport` keyword argument has been deprecated. If you wish to provide a custom transport, please pass a `sentry_sdk.transport.Transport` instance or a subclass.
- The parameter `propagate_hub` in `ThreadingIntegration()` was deprecated and renamed to `propagate_scope`.

## 1.45.0

This is the final 1.x release for the forseeable future. Development will continue on the 2.x release line. The first 2.x version will be available in the next few weeks.

### Various fixes & improvements

- Allow to upsert monitors (#2929) by @sentrivana

  It's now possible to provide `monitor_config` to the `monitor` decorator/context manager directly:

  ```python
  from sentry_sdk.crons import monitor

  # All keys except `schedule` are optional
  monitor_config = {
      "schedule": {"type": "crontab", "value": "0 0 * * *"},
      "timezone": "Europe/Vienna",
      "checkin_margin": 10,
      "max_runtime": 10,
      "failure_issue_threshold": 5,
      "recovery_threshold": 5,
  }

  @monitor(monitor_slug='<monitor-slug>', monitor_config=monitor_config)
  def tell_the_world():
      print('My scheduled task...')
  ```

  Check out [the cron docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/crons/) for details.

- Add Django `signals_denylist` to filter signals that are attached to by `signals_spans` (#2758) by @lieryan

  If you want to exclude some Django signals from performance tracking, you can use the new `signals_denylist` Django option:

  ```python
  import django.db.models.signals
  import sentry_sdk

  sentry_sdk.init(
      ...
      integrations=[
          DjangoIntegration(
              ...
              signals_denylist=[
                  django.db.models.signals.pre_init,
                  django.db.models.signals.post_init,
              ],
          ),
      ],
  )
  ```

- `increment` for metrics (#2588) by @mitsuhiko

  `increment` and `inc` are equivalent, so you can pick whichever you like more.

- Add `value`, `unit` to `before_emit_metric` (#2958) by @sentrivana

  If you add a custom `before_emit_metric`, it'll now accept 4 arguments (the `key`, `value`, `unit` and `tags`) instead of just `key` and `tags`.

  ```python
  def before_emit(key, value, unit, tags):
      if key == "removed-metric":
          return False
      tags["extra"] = "foo"
      del tags["release"]
      return True

  sentry_sdk.init(
      ...
      _experiments={
          "before_emit_metric": before_emit,
      }
  )
  ```

## 1.43.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Add optional `keep_alive` (#2842) by @sentrivana

  If you're experiencing frequent network issues between the SDK and Sentry,
  you can try turning on TCP keep-alive:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk

  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...your usual settings...
      keep_alive=True,
  )
  ```

- Add support for Celery Redbeat cron tasks (#2643) by @kwigley

  The SDK now supports the Redbeat scheduler in addition to the default
  Celery Beat scheduler for auto instrumenting crons. See
  [the docs](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/celery/crons/)
  for more information about how to set this up.

## 1.42.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New integration:** [OpenAI integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/openai/) (#2791) by @colin-sentry

  We added an integration for OpenAI to capture errors and also performance data when using the OpenAI Python SDK.

  Useage:

  This integrations is auto-enabling, so if you have the `openai` package in your project it will be enabled. Just initialize Sentry before you create your OpenAI client.

  ```python
  from openai import OpenAI

  import sentry_sdk

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
      enable_tracing=True,
      traces_sample_rate=1.0,
  )

  client = OpenAI()
  ```

  For more information, see the documentation for [OpenAI integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/openai/).

## 1.41.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Add recursive scrubbing to `EventScrubber` (#2755) by @Cheapshot003

  By default, the `EventScrubber` will not search your events for potential
  PII recursively. With this release, you can enable this behavior with:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.scrubber import EventScrubber

  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...your usual settings...
      event_scrubber=EventScrubber(recursive=True),
  )
  ```

- Expose `socket_options` (#2786) by @sentrivana

  If the SDK is experiencing connection issues (connection resets, server
  closing connection without response, etc.) while sending events to Sentry,
  tweaking the default `urllib3` socket options to the following can help:

  ```python
  import socket
  from urllib3.connection import HTTPConnection
  import sentry_sdk

  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...your usual settings...
      socket_options=HTTPConnection.default_socket_options + [
          (socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_KEEPALIVE, 1),
          # note: skip the following line if you're on MacOS since TCP_KEEPIDLE doesn't exist there
          (socket.SOL_TCP, socket.TCP_KEEPIDLE, 45),
          (socket.SOL_TCP, socket.TCP_KEEPINTVL, 10),
          (socket.SOL_TCP, socket.TCP_KEEPCNT, 6),
      ],
  )

- Warn if uWSGI is set up without proper thread support (#2738) by @sentrivana

    uWSGI has to be run in threaded mode for the SDK to run properly. If this is
    not the case, the consequences could range from features not working unexpectedly
    to uWSGI workers crashing.

    Please make sure to run uWSGI with both `--enable-threads` and `--py-call-uwsgi-fork-hooks`.

## 1.35.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **Updated gRPC integration:** Asyncio interceptors and easier setup (#2369) by @fdellekart

  Our gRPC integration now instruments incoming unary-unary grpc requests and outgoing unary-unary, unary-stream grpc requests using grpcio channels. Everything works now for sync and async code.

  Before this release you had to add Sentry interceptors by hand to your gRPC code, now the only thing you need to do is adding the `GRPCIntegration` to you `sentry_sdk_init()` call. (See [documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/integrations/grpc/) for more information):

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.grpc import GRPCIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
      enable_tracing=True,
      integrations=[
          GRPCIntegration(),
      ],
  )
  ```
  The old way still works, but we strongly encourage you to update your code to the way described above.

## 1.30.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Officially support Python 3.11 (#2300) by @sentrivana
- Context manager monitor (#2290) by @szokeasaurusrex
- Set response status code in transaction `response` context. (#2312) by @antonpirker
- Add missing context kwarg to `_sentry_task_factory` (#2267) by @JohnnyDeuss
- In Postgres take the connection params from the connection  (#2308) by @antonpirker
- Experimental: Allow using OTel for performance instrumentation (#2272) by @sentrivana

    This release includes experimental support for replacing Sentry's default
    performance monitoring solution with one powered by OpenTelemetry without having
    to do any manual setup.

    Try it out by installing `pip install sentry-sdk[opentelemetry-experimental]` and
    then initializing the SDK with:

    ```python
    sentry_sdk.init(
        # ...your usual options...
        _experiments={"otel_powered_performance": True},
    )
    ```

    This enables OpenTelemetry performance monitoring support for some of the most
    popular frameworks and libraries (Flask, Django, FastAPI, requests...).

    We're looking forward to your feedback! Please let us know about your experience
    in this discussion: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry/discussions/55023

    **Important note:** Please note that this feature is experimental and in a
    proof-of-concept stage and is not meant for production use. It may be changed or
    removed at any point.

- Enable backpressure handling by default (#2298) by @sl0thentr0py

    The SDK now dynamically downsamples transactions to reduce backpressure in high
    throughput systems. It starts a new `Monitor` thread to perform some health checks
    which decide to downsample (halved each time) in 10 second intervals till the system
    is healthy again.

    To disable this behavior, use:

    ```python
    sentry_sdk.init(
        # ...your usual options...
        enable_backpressure_handling=False,
    )
    ```

    If your system serves heavy load, please let us know how this feature works for you!

    Check out the [documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#enable-backpressure-handling) for more information.

## 1.25.1

### Django update (ongoing)

Collections of improvements to our Django integration.

By: @mgaligniana (#1773)

### Various fixes & improvements

- Fix `parse_url` (#2161) by @sentrivana and @antonpirker

  Our URL sanitization used in multiple integrations broke with the recent Python security update. If you started seeing `ValueError`s with `"'Filtered' does not appear to be an IPv4 or IPv6 address"`, this release fixes that. See [the original issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-python/issues/2160) for more context.

- Better version parsing in integrations (#2152) by @antonpirker

  We now properly support all integration versions that conform to [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/). This replaces our naïve version parsing that wouldn't accept versions such as `2.0.0rc1` or `2.0.5.post1`.

- Align HTTP status code as span data field `http.response.status_code` (#2113) by @antonpirker
- Do not encode cached value to determine size (#2143) by @sentrivana
- Fix using `unittest.mock` whenever available (#1926) by @mgorny
- Fix 2.7 `common` tests (#2145) by @sentrivana
- Bump `actions/stale` from `6` to `8` (#1978) by @dependabot
- Bump `black` from `22.12.0` to `23.3.0` (#1984) by @dependabot
- Bump `mypy` from `1.2.0` to `1.3.0` (#2110) by @dependabot
- Bump `sphinx` from `5.3.0` to `7.0.1` (#2112) by @dependabot

## 1.25.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Support urllib3>=2.0.0 (#2148) by @asottile-sentry

  We're now supporting urllib3's new major version, 2.0.0. If you encounter issues (e.g. some of your dependencies not supporting the new urllib3 version yet) you might consider pinning the urllib3 version to `<2.0.0` manually in your project. Check out the [the urllib3 migration guide](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-migration-guide.html#migrating-as-an-application-developer) for details.

- Auto-retry tests on failure (#2134) by @sentrivana
- Correct `importlib.metadata` check in `test_modules` (#2149) by @asottile-sentry
- Fix distribution name normalization (PEP-0503) (#2144) by @rominf
- Fix `functions_to_trace` typing (#2141) by @rcmarron

## 1.24.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** Celery Beat exclude tasks option (#2130) by @antonpirker

  You can exclude Celery Beat tasks from being auto-instrumented. To do this, add a list of tasks you want to exclude as option `exclude_beat_tasks` when creating `CeleryIntegration`. The list can contain simple strings with the full task name, as specified in the Celery Beat schedule, or regular expressions to match multiple tasks.

  For more information, see the documentation for [Crons](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/guides/celery/crons/) for more information.

  Usage:

  ```python
      exclude_beat_tasks = [
          "some-task-a",
          "payment-check-.*",
      ]
      sentry_sdk.init(
          dsn='___PUBLIC_DSN___',
          integrations=[
              CeleryIntegration(
                  monitor_beat_tasks=True,
                  exclude_beat_tasks=exclude_beat_tasks,
              ),
          ],
      )
  ```

  In this example the task `some-task-a` and all tasks with a name starting with `payment-check-` will be ignored.

- **New:** Add support for **ExceptionGroups** (#2025) by @antonpirker

  _Note:_ If running Self-Hosted Sentry, you should wait to adopt this SDK update until after updating to the 23.6.0 (est. June 2023) release of Sentry. Updating early will not break anything, but you will not get the full benefit of the Exception Groups improvements to issue grouping that were added to the Sentry backend.

- Prefer `importlib.metadata` over `pkg_resources` if available (#2081) by @sentrivana
- Work with a copy of request, vars in the event (#2125) by @sentrivana
- Pinned version of dependency that broke the build (#2133) by @antonpirker

## 1.23.1

### Various fixes & improvements

- Disable Django Cache spans by default. (#2120) by @antonpirker

## 1.23.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** Add `loguru` integration (#1994) by @PerchunPak

  Check [the documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/integrations/loguru/) for more information.

  Usage:

  ```python
  from loguru import logger
  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.loguru import LoguruIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
      integrations=[
          LoguruIntegration(),
      ],
  )

  logger.debug("I am ignored")
  logger.info("I am a breadcrumb")
  logger.error("I am an event", extra=dict(bar=43))
  logger.exception("An exception happened")
  ```

  - An error event with the message `"I am an event"` will be created.
  - `"I am a breadcrumb"` will be attached as a breadcrumb to that event.
  - `bar` will end up in the `extra` attributes of that event.
  - `"An exception happened"` will send the current exception from `sys.exc_info()` with the stack trace to Sentry. If there's no exception, the current stack will be attached.
  - The debug message `"I am ignored"` will not be captured by Sentry. To capture it, set `level` to `DEBUG` or lower in `LoguruIntegration`.

- Do not truncate request body if `request_bodies` is `"always"` (#2092) by @sentrivana
- Fixed Celery headers for Beat auto-instrumentation (#2102) by @antonpirker
- Add `db.operation` to Redis and MongoDB spans (#2089) by @antonpirker
- Make sure we're importing `redis` the library (#2106) by @sentrivana
- Add `include_source_context` option (#2020) by @farhat-nawaz and @sentrivana

- Remove relay extension from AWS Layer (#2068) by @sl0thentr0py
- Add a note about `pip freeze` to the bug template (#2103) by @sentrivana

## 1.22.2

### Various fixes & improvements

- Fix: Django caching spans when using keyword arguments (#2086) by @antonpirker
- Fix: Duration in Celery Beat tasks monitoring (#2087) by @antonpirker
- Fix: Docstrings of SPANDATA (#2084) by @antonpirker

## 1.22.1

### Various fixes & improvements

- Fix: Handle a list of keys (not just a single key) in Django cache spans (#2082) by @antonpirker

## 1.22.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Add `cache.hit` and `cache.item_size` to Django (#2057) by @antonpirker

  _Note:_ This will add spans for all requests to the caches configured in Django. This will probably add some overhead to your server an also add multiple spans to your performance waterfall diagrams. If you do not want this, you can disable this feature in the DjangoIntegration:

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="...",
      integrations=[
          DjangoIntegration(cache_spans=False),
      ]
  )
  ```

- Use `http.method` instead of `method` (#2054) by @AbhiPrasad
- Handle non-int `exc.status_code` in Starlette (#2075) by @sentrivana
- Handle SQLAlchemy `engine.name` being bytes (#2074) by @sentrivana
- Fix `KeyError` in `capture_checkin` if SDK is not initialized (#2073) by @antonpirker
- Use `functools.wrap` for `ThreadingIntegration` patches to fix attributes (#2080) by @EpicWink
- Pin `urllib3` to <2.0.0 for now (#2069) by @sl0thentr0py

## 1.21.1

### Various fixes & improvements

- Do not send monitor_config when unset (#2058) by @evanpurkhiser
- Add `db.system` span data (#2040, #2042) by @antonpirker
- Fix memory leak in profiling (#2049) by @Zylphrex
- Fix crash loop when returning none in before_send (#2045) by @sentrivana

## 1.21.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Better handling of redis span/breadcrumb data (#2033) by @antonpirker

  _Note:_ With this release we will limit the description of redis db spans and the data in breadcrumbs represting redis db operations to 1024 characters.

  This can can lead to truncated data. If you do not want this there is a new parameter `max_data_size` in `RedisIntegration`. You can set this to `None` for disabling trimming.

  Example for **disabling** trimming of redis commands in spans or breadcrumbs:

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
    integrations=[
      RedisIntegration(max_data_size=None),
    ]
  )
  ```

  Example for custom trim size of redis commands in spans or breadcrumbs:

  ```python
  sentry_sdk.init(
    integrations=[
      RedisIntegration(max_data_size=50),
    ]
  )`

  ```

- Add `db.system` to redis and SQLAlchemy db spans (#2037, #2038, #2039) (#2037) by @AbhiPrasad
- Upgraded linting tooling (#2026) by @antonpirker
- Made code more resilient. (#2031) by @antonpirker

## 1.20.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- Send all events to /envelope endpoint when tracing is enabled (#2009) by @antonpirker

  _Note:_ If you’re self-hosting Sentry 9, you need to stay in the previous version of the SDK or update your self-hosted to at least 20.6.0

- Profiling: Remove profile context from SDK (#2013) by @Zylphrex
- Profiling: Additionl performance improvements to the profiler (#1991) by @Zylphrex

- Fix: Using the Codecov uploader instead of deprecated python package (#2011) by @antonpirker
- Fix: Support for Quart (#2003)` (#2003) by @antonpirker

## 1.19.1

### Various fixes & improvements

- Make auto monitoring beat update support Celery 4 and 5 (#1989) by @antonpirker

## 1.19.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** [Celery Beat](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/userguide/periodic-tasks.html) auto monitoring (#1967) by @antonpirker

  The CeleryIntegration can now also monitor your Celery Beat scheduled tasks automatically using the new [Crons](https://blog.sentry.io/2023/01/04/cron-job-monitoring-beta-because-scheduled-jobs-fail-too/) feature of Sentry.

  To learn more see our [Celery Beat Auto Discovery](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/guides/celery/crons/) documentation.

  Usage:

  ```python
  from celery import Celery, signals
  from celery.schedules import crontab

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration


  app = Celery('tasks', broker='...')
  app.conf.beat_schedule = {
      'set-in-beat-schedule': {
          'task': 'tasks.some_important_task',
          'schedule': crontab(...),
      },
  }


  @signals.celeryd_init.connect
  def init_sentry(**kwargs):
      sentry_sdk.init(
          dsn='...',
          integrations=[CeleryIntegration(monitor_beat_tasks=True)],  # 👈 here
          environment="local.dev.grace",
          release="v1.0",
      )
  ```

  This will auto detect all schedules tasks in your `beat_schedule` and will monitor them with Sentry [Crons](https://blog.sentry.io/2023/01/04/cron-job-monitoring-beta-because-scheduled-jobs-fail-too/).

- **New:** [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) integration (#1911) by @hossein-raeisi

  The [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) integration instruments all incoming requests and outgoing unary-unary, unary-stream grpc requests using grpcio channels.

  To learn more see our [gRPC Integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/integrations/grpc/) documentation.

  On the server:

  ```python
  import grpc
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.grpc.server import ServerInterceptor


  server = grpc.server(
      thread_pool=...,
      interceptors=[ServerInterceptor()],
  )
  ```

  On the client:

  ```python
  import grpc
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.grpc.client import ClientInterceptor


  with grpc.insecure_channel("example.com:12345") as channel:
      channel = grpc.intercept_channel(channel, *[ClientInterceptor()])

  ```

- **New:** socket integration (#1911) by @hossein-raeisi

  Use this integration to create spans for DNS resolves (`socket.getaddrinfo()`) and connection creations (`socket.create_connection()`).

  To learn more see our [Socket Integration](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/integrations/socket/) documentation.

  Usage:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.socket import SocketIntegration
  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",
      integrations=[
          SocketIntegration(),
      ],
  )
  ```

- Fix: Do not trim span descriptions. (#1983) by @antonpirker

## 1.18.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** Implement `EventScrubber` (#1943) by @sl0thentr0py

  To learn more see our [Scrubbing Sensitive Data](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/data-management/sensitive-data/#event-scrubber) documentation.

  Add a new `EventScrubber` class that scrubs certain potentially sensitive interfaces with a `DEFAULT_DENYLIST`. The default scrubber is automatically run if `send_default_pii = False`:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.scrubber import EventScrubber
  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...
      send_default_pii=False,
      event_scrubber=EventScrubber(),  # this is set by default
  )
  ```

  You can also pass in a custom `denylist` to the `EventScrubber` class and filter additional fields that you want.

  ```python
  from sentry_sdk.scrubber import EventScrubber, DEFAULT_DENYLIST
  # custom denylist
  denylist = DEFAULT_DENYLIST + ["my_sensitive_var"]
  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...
      send_default_pii=False,
      event_scrubber=EventScrubber(denylist=denylist),
  )
  ```

- **New:** Added new `functions_to_trace` option for central way of performance instrumentation (#1960) by @antonpirker

  To learn more see our [Tracing Options](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#functions-to-trace) documentation.

  An optional list of functions that should be set up for performance monitoring. For each function in the list, a span will be created when the function is executed.

  ```python
  functions_to_trace = [
      {"qualified_name": "tests.test_basics._hello_world_counter"},
      {"qualified_name": "time.sleep"},
      {"qualified_name": "collections.Counter.most_common"},
  ]

  sentry_sdk.init(
      # ...
      traces_sample_rate=1.0,
      functions_to_trace=functions_to_trace,
  )
  ```

- Updated denylist to include other widely used cookies/headers (#1972) by @antonpirker
- Forward all `sentry-` baggage items (#1970) by @cleptric
- Update OSS licensing (#1973) by @antonpirker
- Profiling: Handle non frame types in profiler (#1965) by @Zylphrex

- Better naming (#1962) by @antonpirker

## 1.17.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** Monitor Celery Beat tasks with Sentry [Cron Monitoring](https://docs.sentry.io/product/crons/).

  With this feature you can make sure that your Celery beat tasks run at the right time and see if they where successful or not.

  > **Warning**
  > Cron Monitoring is currently in beta. Beta features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
  > If you have any questions or feedback, please email us at crons-feedback@sentry.io, reach out via Discord (#cronjobs), or open an issue.

  Usage:

  ```python
  # File: tasks.py

  from celery import Celery, signals
  from celery.schedules import crontab

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.crons import monitor
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.celery import CeleryIntegration


  # 1. Setup your Celery beat configuration

  app = Celery('mytasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')
  app.conf.beat_schedule = {
      'set-in-beat-schedule': {
          'task': 'tasks.tell_the_world',
          'schedule': crontab(hour='10', minute='15'),
          'args': ("in beat_schedule set", ),
      },
  }


  # 2. Initialize Sentry either in `celeryd_init` or `beat_init` signal.

  #@signals.celeryd_init.connect
  @signals.beat_init.connect
  def init_sentry(**kwargs):
      sentry_sdk.init(
          dsn='...',
          integrations=[CeleryIntegration()],
          environment="local.dev.grace",
          release="v1.0.7-a1",
      )


  # 3. Link your Celery task to a Sentry Cron Monitor

  @app.task
  @monitor(monitor_slug='3b861d62-ff82-4aa0-9cd6-b2b6403bd0cf')
  def tell_the_world(msg):
      print(msg)
  ```

- **New:** Add decorator for Sentry tracing (#1089) by @ynouri

  This allows you to use a decorator to setup custom performance instrumentation.

  To learn more see [Custom Instrumentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/).

  Usage: Just add the new decorator to your function, and a span will be created for it:

  ```python
  import sentry_sdk

  @sentry_sdk.trace
  def my_complex_function():
    # do stuff
    ...
  ```

- Make Django signals tracing optional (#1929) by @antonpirker

## 1.16.0

### Various fixes & improvements

- **New:** Add [arq](https://arq-docs.helpmanual.io/) Integration (#1872) by @Zhenay

  This integration will create performance spans when arq jobs will be enqueued and when they will be run.
  It will also capture errors in jobs and will link them to the performance spans.

  Usage:

  ```python
  import asyncio

  from httpx import AsyncClient
  from arq import create_pool
  from arq.connections import RedisSettings

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.arq import ArqIntegration

      integrations=[ArqIntegration()],
  )

  async def download_content(ctx, url):
      session: AsyncClient = ctx['session']
      response = await session.get(url)
      print(f'{url}: {response.text:.80}...')
      return len(response.text)

  async def startup(ctx):
      ctx['session'] = AsyncClient()

  async def shutdown(ctx):
      await ctx['session'].aclose()

  async def main():
      with sentry_sdk.start_transaction(name="testing_arq_tasks", source=TRANSACTION_SOURCE_COMPONENT):

### Various fixes & improvements

- New: Add [Huey](https://huey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) Integration (#1555) by @Zhenay

  This integration will create performance spans when Huey tasks will be enqueued and when they will be executed.

  Usage:

  Task definition in `demo.py`:

  ```python
  import time

  from huey import SqliteHuey, crontab

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.huey import HueyIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="...",
      integrations=[
          HueyIntegration(),
      ],
      traces_sample_rate=1.0,
  )

  huey = SqliteHuey(filename='/tmp/demo.db')

  @huey.task()
  def add_numbers(a, b):
      return a + b
  ```

  Running the tasks in `run.py`:

  ```python
  from demo import add_numbers, flaky_task, nightly_backup

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.huey import HueyIntegration
  from sentry_sdk.tracing import TRANSACTION_SOURCE_COMPONENT, Transaction

### Various fixes & improvements

- Add `before_send_transaction` (#1840) by @antonpirker

  Adds a hook (similar to `before_send`) that is called for all transaction events (performance releated data).

  Usage:

  ```python
    import sentry_sdk

- Add Starlite integration (#1748) by @gazorby

  Adding support for the [Starlite](https://starlite-api.github.io/starlite/1.48/) framework. Unhandled errors are captured. Performance spans for Starlite middleware are also captured. Thanks @gazorby for the great work!

  Usage:

  ```python
  from starlite import Starlite, get

  import sentry_sdk
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlite import StarliteIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="...",
      traces_sample_rate=1.0,
      integrations=[
          StarliteIntegration(),
      ],
  )

  @get("/")
  def hello_world() -> dict[str, str]:
      """Keeping the tradition alive with hello world."""
      bla = 1/0  # causing an error
      return {"hello": "world"}

  app = Starlite(route_handlers=[hello_world])
  ```

- Unified naming for span ops (#1661) by @antonpirker

  We have unified the strings of our span operations. See https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-operations/

  **WARNING**: If you have Sentry Dashboards or Sentry Discover queries that use `transaction.op` in their fields, conditions, aggregates or columns this change could potentially break your Dashboards/Discover setup.
  Here is a list of the changes we made to the `op`s. Please adjust your dashboards and Discover queries accordingly:

  | Old operation (`op`)     | New Operation (`op`)   |
  | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
  | `asgi.server`            | `http.server`          |
  | `aws.request`            | `http.client`          |
  | `aws.request.stream`     | `http.client.stream`   |
  | `celery.submit`          | `queue.submit.celery`  |
  | `celery.task`            | `queue.task.celery`    |
  | `django.middleware`      | `middleware.django`    |
  | `django.signals`         | `event.django`         |
  | `django.template.render` | `template.render`      |
  | `django.view`            | `view.render`          |
  | `http`                   | `http.client`          |
  | `redis`                  | `db.redis`             |

### Various fixes & improvements

- Let SentryAsgiMiddleware work with Starlette and FastAPI integrations (#1594) by @antonpirker

**Note:** The last version 1.9.6 introduced a breaking change where projects that used Starlette or FastAPI
and had manually setup `SentryAsgiMiddleware` could not start. This versions fixes this behaviour.
With this version if you have a manual `SentryAsgiMiddleware` setup and are using Starlette or FastAPI
everything just works out of the box.

Sorry for any inconveniences the last version might have brought to you.

We can do better and in the future we will do our best to not break your code again.

  from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="...",
      integrations=[StarletteIntegration()],
  )

  app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=[...])
  ```

- feat(fastapi): add FastAPI integration (#829) by @antonpirker

  **Important:** Remove manual usage of `SentryAsgiMiddleware`! This is now done by the FastAPI integration.

  Usage:

  ```python
  from fastapi import FastAPI

  from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.fastapi import FastApiIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="...",
      integrations=[StarletteIntegration(), FastApiIntegration()],
  )

  app = FastAPI()
  ```

  Yes, you have to add both, the `StarletteIntegration` **AND** the `FastApiIntegration`!

## 0.16.5

- Fix a bug that caused Django apps to crash if the view didn't have a `__name__` attribute.

## 0.16.4

- APM: Add spans for more methods on `subprocess.Popen` objects.
- APM: Add spans for Django middlewares.
- APM: Add spans for ASGI requests.
- Automatically inject the ASGI middleware for Django Channels 2.0. This will **break your Channels 2.0 application if it is running on Python 3.5 or 3.6** (while previously it would "only" leak a lot of memory for each ASGI request). **Install `aiocontextvars` from PyPI to make it work again.**

## 0.10.0

- Massive refactor in preparation to tracing. There are no intentional breaking changes, but there is a risk of breakage (hence the minor version bump). Two new client options `traces_sample_rate` and `traceparent_v2` have been added. Do not change the defaults in production, they will bring your application down or at least fill your Sentry project up with nonsense events.
