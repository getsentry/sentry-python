# Changelog

## 1.12.0

### Basic OTel support

This adds support to automatically integrate OpenTelemetry performance tracing with Sentry.

See the documentation on how to set it up:
https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/performance/instrumentation/opentelemetry/

Give it a try and let us know if you have any feedback or problems with using it.

### Various fixes & improvements

- Unified naming for span ops (#1661) by @antonpirker

  We have unified the strings of our span operations. See https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/performance/span-operations/

  **WARNING**: If you have Sentry Dashboards or Sentry Discover queries that use `transaction.op` in their fields, conditions, aggregates or columns this change could potentially break your Dashboards/Discover setup.
  Here is a list of the changes we made to the `op`s. Please adjust your dashboards and Discover queries accordingly:

  | Old operation (`op`)     | New Operation (`op`)   |
  | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
  | `asgi.server`            | `http.server`          |
  | `aws.request`            | `http.client`          |
  | `aws.request.stream`     | `http.client.stream`   |
  | `celery.submit`          | `queue.submit.celery`  |
  | `celery.task`            | `queue.task.celery`    |
  | `django.middleware`      | `middleware.django`    |
  | `django.signals`         | `event.django`         |
  | `django.template.render` | `template.render`      |
  | `django.view`            | `view.render`          |
  | `http`                   | `http.client`          |
  | `redis`                  | `db.redis`             |
  | `rq.task`                | `queue.task.rq`        |
  | `serverless.function`    | `function.aws`         |

## 1.9.7

### Various fixes & improvements

- Let SentryAsgiMiddleware work with Starlette and FastAPI integrations (#1594) by @antonpirker

**Note:** The last version 1.9.6 introduced a breaking change where projects that used Starlette or FastAPI
and had manually setup `SentryAsgiMiddleware` could not start. This versions fixes this behaviour.
With this version if you have a manual `SentryAsgiMiddleware` setup and are using Starlette or FastAPI
everything just works out of the box.

Sorry for any inconveniences the last version might have brought to you.

We can do better and in the future we will do our best to not break your code again.

  **Important:** Remove manual usage of `SentryAsgiMiddleware`! This is now done by the Starlette integration.
  Usage:

  ```python
  from starlette.applications import Starlette

  from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="...",
      integrations=[StarletteIntegration()],
  )

  app = Starlette(debug=True, routes=[...])
  ```

- feat(fastapi): add FastAPI integration (#829) by @antonpirker

  **Important:** Remove manual usage of `SentryAsgiMiddleware`! This is now done by the FastAPI integration.

  Usage:

  ```python
  from fastapi import FastAPI

  from sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration
  from sentry_sdk.integrations.fastapi import FastApiIntegration

  sentry_sdk.init(
      dsn="...",
      integrations=[StarletteIntegration(), FastApiIntegration()],
  )

  app = FastAPI()
  ```

  Yes, you have to add both, the `StarletteIntegration` **AND** the `FastApiIntegration`!

- Fix timezone bugs in AWS Lambda integration.

- Add a span around the Django view in transactions to distinguish its operations from middleware operations.

## 0.16.3

- Fix AWS Lambda support for Python 3.8.
- The AWS Lambda integration now captures initialization/import errors for Python 3.

- **Breaking change**: `before_send` is no longer called for transactions.

## 0.15.1

- Basic support for Django 3.1. More work is required for async middlewares to be instrumented properly for APM.

- Fix bugs in transport rate limit enforcement for specific data categories. The bug should not have affected anybody because we do not yet emit rate limits for specific event types/data categories.
- Fix a bug in `capture_event` where it would crash if given additional kwargs. Thanks to Tatiana Vasilevskaya!
- Fix a bug where contextvars from the request handler were inaccessible in AIOHTTP error handlers.

- Fix trace continuation bugs in APM.
- No longer report `asyncio.CancelledError` as part of AIOHTTP integration.

- The AIOHTTP integration now attaches the request body to crash reports. Thanks to Vitali Rebkavets!
- Add an experimental PySpark integration.
- First release to be tested under Python 3.8. No code changes were necessary though, so previous releases also might have worked.

- APM: Add spans for more methods on `subprocess.Popen` objects.
- APM: Add spans for Django middlewares.
- APM: Add spans for ASGI requests.
- Automatically inject the ASGI middleware for Django Channels 2.0. This will **break your Channels 2.0 application if it is running on Python 3.5 or 3.6** (while previously it would "only" leak a lot of memory for each ASGI request). **Install `aiocontextvars` from PyPI to make it work again.**

- Fix bug in stdlib integration that would cause spawned subprocesses to not inherit the environment variables from the parent process.

## 0.10.0

- Massive refactor in preparation to tracing. There are no intentional breaking changes, but there is a risk of breakage (hence the minor version bump). Two new client options `traces_sample_rate` and `traceparent_v2` have been added. Do not change the defaults in production, they will bring your application down or at least fill your Sentry project up with nonsense events.
