# Need to add some ignore rules in this directory, because the unit tests will add the Sentry SDK and its dependencies 
# into this directory to create a Lambda function package that contains everything needed to instrument a Lambda function using Sentry.

# Ignore everything
*

# But not index.py
!index.py

# And not .gitignore itself
!.gitignore
