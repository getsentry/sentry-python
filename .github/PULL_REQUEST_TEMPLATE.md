Thank you for contributing to `sentry-python`! Please add tests to validate your changes, and lint your code using `tox -e linters`.

Running the test suite on your PR might require maintainer approval. The AWS Lambda tests additionally require a maintainer to add a special label, and they will fail until this label is added.
