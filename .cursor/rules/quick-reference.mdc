# Quick Reference

## Common Commands

### Development Setup
```bash
make .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Testing

Our test matrix is implemented in [tox](mdc:https://tox.wiki).
The following runs the whole test suite and takes a long time.

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
tox
```

Prefer testing a single environment instead while developing.

```bash
tox -e py3.12-common
```

For running a single test, use the pattern:

```bash
tox -e py3.12-common -- project/tests/test_file.py::TestClassName::test_method
```

For testing specific integrations, refer to the test matrix in [sentry_sdk/tox.ini](mdc:sentry_sdk/tox.ini) for finding an entry.
For example, to test django, use:

```bash
tox -e py3.12-django-v5.2.3
```

### Code Quality

Our `linters` tox environment runs `black` for formatting, `flake8` for linting and `mypy` for type checking.

```bash
tox -e linters
```
