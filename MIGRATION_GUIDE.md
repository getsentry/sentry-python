# Sentry SDK 2.0 Migration Guide

**WIP:** Please add any 2.0 changes here with instructions how to adapt to the new behavior, if applicable.

## New Features

## Changed

- The `BackgroundWorker` thread used to process events was renamed from `raven-sentry.BackgroundWorker` to `sentry-sdk.BackgroundWorker`.
- The `reraise` function was moved from `sentry_sdk._compat` to `sentry_sdk.utils`.
- Moved the contents of `tracing_utils_py3.py` to `tracing_utils.py`. The `start_child_span_decorator` is now in `sentry_sdk.tracing_utils`.
- The actual implementation of `get_current_span` was moved to `sentry_sdk.tracing_utils`. `sentry_sdk.get_current_span` is still accessible as part of the top-level API.
- Additional integrations will now be activated automatically if the SDK detects the respective package is installed: Ariadne, ARQ, asyncpg, Chalice, clickhouse-driver, GQL, Graphene, huey, Loguru, PyMongo, Quart, Starlite, Strawberry.
- The Pyramid integration will not capture errors that might happen in `authenticated_userid()` in a custom `AuthenticationPolicy` class.
- Setting the parameter `propagate_hub` to `True` in `ThreadingIntegration(propagate_hub=True)` does only work on Python 3.7+.

## Removed

- Removed support for Python 2 and Python 3.5. The SDK now requires at least Python 3.6.
- Removed support for Celery 3.\*.
- Removed support for Django 1.8, 1.9, 1.10.
- Removed support for Flask 0.\*.
- `sentry_sdk._functools` was removed.
- A number of compatibility utilities were removed from `sentry_sdk._compat`: the constants `PY2` and `PY33`; the functions `datetime_utcnow`, `utc_from_timestamp`, `implements_str`, `contextmanager`; and the aliases `text_type`, `string_types`, `number_types`, `int_types`, `iteritems`, `binary_sequence_types`.
- The deprecated `with_locals` configuration option was removed. Use `include_local_variables` instead. See https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#include-local-variables.
- The deprecated `request_bodies` configuration option was removed. Use `max_request_body_size`. See https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/python/configuration/options/#max-request-body-size.
- Removed `sentry_sdk.utils.Auth.store_api_url`.
- `sentry_sdk.utils.Auth.get_api_url`'s now accepts a `sentry_sdk.consts.EndpointType` enum instead of a string as its only parameter. We recommend omitting this argument when calling the function, since the parameter's default value is the only possible `sentry_sdk.consts.EndpointType` value. The parameter exists for future compatibility.
- Removed `tracing_utils_py2.py`. The `start_child_span_decorator` is now in `sentry_sdk.tracing_utils`.
- Removed support for the `install` method for custom integrations. Please use `setup_once` instead.
- Removed `sentry_sdk.tracing.Span.new_span`. Use `sentry_sdk.tracing.Span.start_child` instead.
- Removed `sentry_sdk.tracing.Transaction.new_span`. Use `sentry_sdk.tracing.Transaction.start_child` instead.
- Removed support for the `install` method for custom integrations. Please use `setup_once` instead.
- Removed `sentry_sdk.tracing.Span.new_span`. Use `sentry_sdk.tracing.Span.start_child` instead.
- Removed `sentry_sdk.tracing.Transaction.new_span`. Use `sentry_sdk.tracing.Transaction.start_child` instead.
- Removed support for `user.segment`. It was also removed from the trace header as well as from the dynamic sampling context.

## Deprecated

- Deprecated `sentry_sdk.transport.Transport.capture_event`. Please use `sentry_sdk.transport.Transport.capture_envelope`, instead.
- Passing a function to `sentry_sdk.init`'s `transport` keyword argument has been deprecated. If you wish to provide a custom transport, please pass a `sentry_sdk.transport.Transport` instance or a subclass.
- `profiler_mode` and `profiles_sample_rate` have been deprecated as `_experiments` options. Use them as top level options instead:
    ```python
        sentry_sdk.init(
            ...,
            profiler_mode="thread",
            profiles_sample_rate=1.0,
        )
    ```
